# Hello, world! 👋

My name is **Finn O'Driscoll**, and I am a passionate web development student from **Calgary AB, Canada 🇨🇦**.

I am corrently enrolled in my second year of  [Interactive Design - Web Design & Development](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/interactive-design-web-design-and-development) at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/).

I have always felt a need to solve problems; evaulating a problem and designing an intuitive solution brings me a great deal of satisfaction. As a team player who welcomes coplex challenges, web design has enabled me to start building a career based on passion.

Steve Jobs once said: 

>*"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."*

I intend to build things that people <mark>**need to use.**</mark>
